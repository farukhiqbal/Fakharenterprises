When used, HBY forestry fire hose is protected from mildew and no drying is required. Its tightly woven cover is specially treated for enhanced durability, reduced friction when dragging, and resistance to ozone, weathering, mildew, aging, and regular abrasion. Its PU tube provides much better resistance to punctures, mildew, petroleum, solvents, and aging as compared to conventional rubber fire hoses – and it is only a fraction of the weight and is much more compact. A stripe of a contrasting color running the full length of the hose can be woven into the jacket. This meets NFPA recommendations for pump panel identification Forestry fire fighting, standby forestry fire protection. Due to its light duty characteristics, we do NOT recommend this hose be used for washdown or in construction, rental, plant, or mill service.   ',
